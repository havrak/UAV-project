# Desktop client

Application to be run on the PC controlling the drone.
As I am primary a linux user I will write and test it on linux however I have decided to write it in C++ with GTK toolkit so it should be cross-platform.
From time to time I will maybe test and do work on windows version but it is not my priority.
